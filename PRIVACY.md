# Privacy Policy

Last updated: *10/17/2024*

This privacy policy explains how the bot (the "Application") collects, uses, and protects data obtained through the OAuth2 integration with Google.

## 1. Information Collected

The Application uses OAuth2 to access limited data from your Google account to provide its functionality. The information collected includes:

- OAuth2 Access Tokens: Used to authenticate the Application and allow access to specific services authorized by the user.
- Specific YouTube API Data: Such as live chat messages and the ability to post messages to authorized live chats.

No additional personal information such as your email address, name, or other Google account data is collected.

## 2. Use of Data

The data collected is used solely for the following purposes:

- Reading live chat messages from YouTube to relay them to another service (e.g., Twitch).
- Posting messages to YouTube live chat based on user instructions.

The Application does not store personal data or OAuth2 tokens permanently. Tokens are used only during the botâ€™s runtime and are deleted when the process ends.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share any data obtained through OAuth2 with third parties unless:

- You explicitly authorize us to do so.
- We are required to do so by law.

## 4. Security

We implement security measures to protect the data collected, including:

- OAuth2 tokens are securely stored during the application's runtime.
- Communications between the bot and Google services use HTTPS to ensure data encryption in transit.

## 5. Consent

By using the Application and authorizing access via OAuth2, you consent to the collection and use of data as described in this policy.

## 6. User Rights

You can revoke the Application's access to your Google account at any time through your Google Account Settings.

## 7. Policy Changes

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. Changes will be posted on [here](https://github.com/voisinhugo/multistream-chatbot/PRIVACY.md).
